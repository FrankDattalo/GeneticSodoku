There are multiple ways to run this project.

To run either genetic/hillclimb search directly, 
navigate to the respective Main.java classes within the respective packages.

Provide the command line arguments to the program through the eclipse menu.

Each package also contains TestHarness.java classes to run the respective
algorithms. 

Finally, included in the test package, is StdinTestHarness.java which can be 
used to set up either problem by reading from standard input. The program
prompts the user for either <hc/ga> for hill climbing or genenetic algorithm 
respectively, then the location of the file. Then the respective algorithm is 
run for the specified file.

Both algorithms were also tested with the test cases within the test folder.
Each test file contains a different test situation.

test1.txt - the provided test case.
test2.txt - modified version of test1.txt.
test3.txt - test empty board.
test4.txt - almost completed board.
test5.txt - completed board.
test6.txt - a completed board minus one position.
